# LeagueOfLegendsBannerBot

This is a discord bot that uses discord.js v14 to ban any user who plays League of Legends.

This isnt super complicated, whenever someone's presence on discord changes (One way of doing that is playing a game since that changes what activities you were doing). It then cycles through the list of the user's activities assuming there is one, compares the name of that activity with the banned game, in this case League of Legends. When this comparison is successful, it bans the user.

## Why??
I did it because I saw a meme about it once and thought it was funny and may as well do it myself.
